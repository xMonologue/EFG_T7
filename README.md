# What is EFG T7 MONOLOGUE????

EFG T7 is a game modification for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 based on boiii.  
The Steam version of Black Ops 3 is required to be owned and installed for BOIII to work (Or you can use a cracked version of bo3 with the latest version but we do not recommend it). You can get it from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/311210/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_III/">here</a>.

## BUILD IN WORKSHOP DOWNLOADER:
- Added workshop mod dowloader which is using steamcmd to download mod from steam workshop if mod is not found while joining server. For this option to work server host has to add ```set workshop_id "your item workshop id"``` in to server_zm.cfg which can be found in zone folder or host can start server once and let it fully start for the launcher to find workshop id of loaded mod. After this server has to be restarted again for server_zm.cfg being loaded with new workshop id which was written in first start.

- Client will be restarted after mod has been downloaded to refresh workshop items. (Did not have time to figure out how it is done)
